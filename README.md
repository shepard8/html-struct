The reference when it comes to HTML5 is the W3C specification.

Although it is really complete and clear, it is also a very big document. To
support the effort of the TyXML developers who try to come up with types that
represent a valid HTML5 document, Html-struct parses the HTML5 specification,
more specifically the elements data of the HTML5 specification, and store this
data in OCaml structures that are easy to work with.

As this data could maybe be useful to developers from other languages, an
executable also exports this data to the SQL format.
